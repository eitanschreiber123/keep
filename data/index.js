There is a double tomb in the Alphonse graveyard which, according to tradition, is that of a Monsieur and Madame Huteau. In 1862 Alphonse was sold to the Daubans, who also owned Silhouette. The British authorities contested the legality of the sale, but Monsieur Dauban was granted legal title in 1866. However, disputes over ownership of the outer islands meant that Alphonse did not legally become part of Seychelles until 1881. Coconuts were grown for copra, while turtle meat, turtle shell and pearl shell were exploited. Alphonse was a particularly fertile island, due to deposits of guano left by huge colonies of seabirds in the past. Maize, pumpkin, banana, sweet potato, pineapple and chickens were also produced. There have been many shipwrecks on both atolls, the wreckage of some still visible today`, conservation: `Island Conservation Society has run a conservation centre on Alphonse since 2007. Programmes are approved by Alphonse Foundation, which brings together ICS, IDC, hotel investors and the Ministry of Environment. Guests contribute a conservation levy helping to fund programmes. Wedge-tailed Shearwaters and other seabirds breed. The isolation of the group acts as a magnet to migratory birds and more bird species have been recorded here than anywhere south of the granitics apart from Aldabra. There is a small breeding population of Black-naped Tern at St François, which also hosts globally significant numbers of Crab Plover and Saunders’s Tern plus Seychelles’ largest concentrations of Whimbrel, Ruddy Turnstone and Grey Plover. Coconuts still dominate the woodland but there are areas of more natural forest. Significant numbers of hawksbills and green turtles nest and the waters of the atolls provide important foraging habitat for immature turtles`, economic: `Alphonse Island has one hotel, Alphonse Island Resort, which opened for business in 1999. The resort was constructed by IDC and IDC provides on-going support facilities. These include utilities and maintenance together with air and sea links to and from Mahe. The resort features accommodation comprising of A-frame chalets and bungalows built near to the water’s edge. The main interest and focus for guests of the resort is fly-fishing on nearby St Francois but other visitors are also welcomed.

Abbott’s Booby today is one of the rarest seabirds in the world, nesting only on Christmas Island (Indian Ocean). It nested in tall trees, but these were cleared to make way for guano mining which commenced when a settlement was built on Assomption in 1908. Dupont reported that by 1909, the boobies were extinct. By 1937, the island had been largely cleared of vegetation and was covered by a thick mat of lerb payanke. Giant tortoises, endemic land birds and seabirds were all lost. Over 160,000 tons of guano was scraped off Assomption in the twenty years before 1945 and it was believed that just as much remained. Some deposits were recorded as being 50 feet thick. Guano mining was abandoned in 1984`, conservation: `Today, Assomption is one of the most devastated islands of Seychelles due to guano mining, which destroyed the natural habitat. However, coral reef life is dazzling; much of Jacques Cousteau’s film The Silent World was shot here. Apart from a race of Souimanga Sunbird, endemic birds have been exterminated, including a flightless rail. Alien birds were introduced but were eradicated by Seychelles Islands Foundation. Assomption was probably never thickly wooded; tortoise turf is dominant on cliffs and dunes. Around the settlement coconuts, casuarina and bodanmyen have been planted. There are three native species of lizard including an endemic race of Abbott’s Day Gecko. There is a small population of giant tortoises. Turtles breed in good numbers though significantly fewer in number than in the past`, economic: `​The airstrip at Assomption is maintained and operated by IDC.

Stirling’s diary gives one of the earliest insights into the nature of the outer islands. Sergeant Rivers visited Astove in 1878 and reported no trace of any residents, though he found a well dug by shipwrecked sailors in the southeast. In1895, James Spurs left four men here to start a fishing enterprise. In 1901, Bergne found the atoll abandoned although 60 hectares had been cleared for maize, tomatoes, pumpkins and several hundred coconuts had been planted. Five workers were left there and by 1908, a visitor found cultivated gourds, pumpkins, watermelons, maize and tobacco. Guano extraction proved profitable and by 1960 more than 72,000 tons of guano had been extracted but reserves were estimated at less than 5,000 tons. In 1968, the lease was passed to Mark and Wendy Veevers-Carter but later abandoned`, conservation: `Four land bird species still survive: The vegetation of Astove is similar to Cosmoledo including several plant species found only on other islands of the Aldabra group. The shoreline of the lagoon is fringed with bwa-d-amann and bwa matlo. There are areas of sisal which is very difficult to penetrate in places. The eastern rim of the atoll, exposed to the strong southeast winds, is almost bare of trees except for a few coconuts. Mangroves grow along much of the lagoon shore, especially in the southeast and close to Gueule Bras Channel. Astove is renowned for its butterflies. Giant tortoises were exterminated from Astove early in human history but have been re-introduced from Aldabra. The Astove Day Gecko is an endemic subspecies. Green turtles breed. The reefs of Astove are the most spectacular in Seychelles. Renowned underwater photographer Stan Waterman pronounced it to be the most spectacular coral reef he had ever seen`, economic: `​In 2015, IDC re-opened the airstrip constructed several decades earlier but subsequently abandoned and overgrown.

By 1929 Coëtivy was managed by a French group and exported timber, copra, salt fish and turtle meat to Mahé.  It was a valuable property, producing over 200,000 coconuts a month.  By the early 1960s over 100 acres of coconut palms had been planted. Until 1908, Coëtivy remained politically part of Mauritius. The island was managed by IDC in the 1980s when it became the focus for hybrid coconut trials in an effort to increase yields. However, results were disappointing. In 1989, management was transferred to Seychelles Marketing Board for the development of a black tiger prawn farm, with brood stocks imported from Madagascar and Mozambique. This was not profitable and eventually the farm closed`, conservation: `Coëtivy is one of only two islands where introduced Grey Francolin still survive (the other being Desroches). This species was originally introduced to many islands as a game bird to provide sport for visiting dignitaries. There is also a major frigatebird roost with up to 2,500 birds of two different species (Great Frigatebird and Lesser Frigatebird) estimated to be present. Most of the undeveloped area of the island is covered in coconuts.  Coëtivy is an important nesting site for both hawksbills and green turtles. The waters around Coëtivy are rich feeding grounds for pelagic seabirds including Round Island Petrel, a visitor from Mauritius and storm petrels from as far away as Antarctica, notably Wilson's Storm Petrel and Black-bellied Storm Petrel`, economic: `​IDC maintains and operates an airstrip at Coëtivy.

In 1878, Rivers reported that judging by the turtle remains, fishermen and whalers frequently called. He found a recently destroyed hut and ‘turtle park’ on Menai; a hut on Wizard built from the wreckage of the Merry Monarch (wrecked in 1874), had also been burnt. He found  mangroves had been felled, but Menai was still virtually covered with tall trees. A few goats were seen by Rivers. Cosmoledo was settled shortly after this and Baty visiting in 1895, noted 200-300 coconut trees, maize and goats. In 1901 there were just two men on Menai, one on Wizard and four on Ile Nord-est. Exploitation of guano on Ile Nord-est was taking place. A small settlement was eventually  abandoned in 1992`, conservation: `Cosmoledo is an Important Bird Area due mainly to globally significant populations of seabirds. Seven land bird species that still survive on Aldabra have been wiped out but could be reintroduced one day. Five others remain. The flora is similar to that of Aldabra, with fewer species but including several plants endemic to the group. As on Aldabra there are areas of tall mangrove, especially on the lagoon side of Menai. Lizards include Madagascar Banded Lizard, the latter found nowhere else in Seychelles. Green turtle nest in reasonably large numbers. Despite the years of over-exploitation, Cosmoledo remains the finest unprotected site in Seychelles.

Fish up to 130 pounds are caught on fly with Bonefish, Yellowfin Tuna and Milkfish among prey species. Fly-fishermen travel by IDC plane to Astove, then travel by boat to Cosmoledo. Since 2018, a temporary eco-lodge has been set up on Wizard Island (Grand Ile) in the south east of the atoll.

In the 1880s, copra became the major source of income. By 1906 Desroches was producing 15-20,000 coconuts a month. On English charts it was called Wood Island, because of the extensive native forest and in 1835 when the island was first settled, many casuarina trees were planted, creating a forest which provided timber, fuel and charcoal.  A visitor in 1906 mentioned that the island was still exporting firewood.  Pockets of this forest remain.

Private lessees made money from a coconut plantation and the export of products including dried fish, maize and guano. Captain Cauvin is buried on Farquhar in a standing position. Owner of the boat La Felice, he is said to have foreseen his own death. Two days after Cauvin died, a ship arrived and to the surprise of the islanders, on board was his replacement.  It seemed that Cauvin had taken the trouble to order his replacement in advance, knowing he would soon be dead. Residents of Farquhar swear that Captain Cauvin continues to haunt the island.  The settlement on North Island was dominated by a particularly grand plantation house, used by the manager and visitors but destroyed in 2016 by Cyclone Fantala. In 1965, Farquhar became a part of British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). Just prior to Seychelles’ independence, Farquhar was returned to Seychelles. Former President Albert Rene spent his early years on Farquhar when his father was manager of the atoll`, conservation: `A Conservation Centre is run by Island Conservation Society. The islets of Farquhar (excluding North, South and the Manahas) form an Important Bird Area. Goëlettes is the most interesting for birds, including a huge seasonal colony of Sooty Terns. Roseate Tern (the most southerly breeding site in Seychelles) and Brown Noddy also breed. Red-footed Booby breed mainly on South Island, including the only breeding population of white-tailed brown morph in Seychelles. In 2006, ICS recorded a previously unknown colony of Black-naped Terns, the largest population in Seychelles. Studies by Seychelles Fishing Authority have shown that the abundance of some grouper species is three times greater than in the north Amirantes and up to thirty times than in the granitics. The density of Napoleon Wrasse is phenomenal, possibly the highest in the world. On the edge of the reef, at certain times of year, there are spawning aggregations of thousands of Camouflage Grouper and Brown-marbled Grouper. Farquhar is also an important nesting site for turtles. Other fauna of interest includes the Gold-dust Gecko and Coconut Crab`, economic: `IDC built an airstrip to improve communications with Mahé.

The island was visited by Charles Oger who took possession of it in the name of the King of France on the 28th January 1771. In the early days of settlement, several proprietors were granted ‘concessions’ including the corsair Jean- François Hodoul. The island was later leased and then sold, as one entity to the Dauban family, whose impressive mausoleum still stands. The Daubans bought the island in 1860 and owned it for a hundred years. They were plantation owners of French extraction and made real efforts towards profitable farming, clearing forest on the flat land in order to plant coconut palms and fruit trees, and building the necessary supporting infrastructure. As the number of labourers living and working on the island grew to around 1,000 a jetty was built at La Passe, (which is still the main landing point), houses for the staff were constructed and wide tracks were laid to facilitate the transport of produce by mule to La Passe. The Dauban era came to an end when Henri Dauban sold the island to a French group.

The whole of Silhouette has been classified as an Important Bird Area due to endemics including Seychelles Kestrel, otherwise found only on Mahe, Praslin and some satellite islands.  Conservationists are currently considering the potential for the introduction of other granitic island endemics. Sheath-tailed Bat, the rarest bat in the world, has its last major stronghold on Silhouette. Most of the 75 or so endemic plants of the granitic islands are found on Silhouette, some of them unique to Silhouette. One of the rarest of these is the Critically Endangered Impatiens gordonii, a white-flowered relative of the well-known garden plant Busy Lizzie, only ever recorded on Mahe and Silhouette. For many years it was thought to be extinct but two plants were rediscovered on Mahe. Then in 1995 a population of some 200 plants was found on Silhouette. It hosts a significant hawksbill nesting population. In 1987 the waters around Silhouette were declared a Marine National Park. Silhouette National Park was opened on the 7th August 2010. This protects 93% of the landmass`, economic: `​IDC maintains the utilities and facilities of Silhouette. It also operates a Guest House.
